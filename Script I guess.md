### Slide 1

**Thank you, Cole. To continue looking at ways airports can reduce time on the ground we will look into how airports manage Activity Levels and Taxi Delays.**

### Slide 2

**First, we need to define the different levels of activity. We categorized each hour into three categories based on the number of flights in and out of the airport:**

1. **Not Busy:** The bottom 25% of hours by number of flights.
2. **Normal:** The middle 50% of hours by number of flights.
3. **Busy:** The top 25% of hours by number of flights.

**It's important to note that activity levels are airport-specific. This means a busy hour at MCO (Orlando) involves fewer flights than a busy hour at ATL (Atlanta).**

### Slide 3 (Consider removing)

**This box plot, with activity level on the x-axis and taxi out time on the y-axis, shows that taxi times are longer during busier periods.**

### Slide 4

**We used a logistic regression model to examine how the origin and activity level impacted the frequency of delays.**

**We found that ATL (Atlanta) managed busy periods most effectively compared to other Airports, while MIA (Miami) was the least effective.**

### Slide 5

**When examining how each airport manages traffic, we looked at the frequency of 15-minute or longer taxi delays.**

**We found that ATL (Atlanta) was the best at reducing taxi delays, while Chicago O'Hare was the worst.**

### Slide 6

**Managing taxi delays and busy periods is crucial because these events impact early flights the most.**

**This bar chart shows that peak taxi delay frequency occurs between 9-10 am.**

### Slide 7

**Similarly, the number of busy flights also peaks between 9-10 am.**

### Slide 8

**Addressing early delays is important because they have a trickle-down effect on the rest of the day.**

**On average, planes flying through one of our top 10 airports have 4.3 flights per day.**

### Slide 9

**This is illustrated visually by the increasing frequency of delays over the course of the day.**

### Slide 10

**From our analysis, we recommend looking into Atlanta's traffic management systems for application to other airports.**

**We also suggest focusing on busy periods early in the day to minimize the snowball effect on future delays.**

Now, Annika will talk about the impacts of weather delays.
