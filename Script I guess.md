### Slide 1

**Thank you, Cole. To continue looking at ways airports can reduce time on the ground we will look into how airports manage Activity Levels and Taxi Delays.**

- Thank Cole
- Airports reduce delay
- Activity Level and Taxi Delays
### Slide 2

**First, we need to define the different levels of activity. We classified each hour into three categories based on the number of flights arriving and departing from the airport:**

1. **Not Busy:** The bottom 25% of hours by number of flights.
2. **Normal:** The middle 50%
3. **Busy:** The top 25%

**It's important to note that activity levels are airport-specific. This means an average busy hour at MCO fewer flights than a busy hour at ATL.**

- Activity Level
- Not Busy: Lowest 25% of hours by traffic
- Normal: Middle 50% 
- Busy: Top 25% 
- Airport Based: A busy hour at MCO has fewer flights than a busy hour at ATL
### Slide 3 (Consider removing)

This box-plot shows how the distribution of Taxi out time changes by activity level. 

### Slide 4

Activity level also impacts Frequency of delays to different degrees based on Origin airport. ATL had the best management of busy periods, and MIA had the worst.

### Slide 5

To look into how each airport manages taxi time ,we created a new delay type, Taxi delay. Taxi delay is the difference between the taxi time and the average taxi time for that airport. This bar chart shows the frequency of taxi delays over 15 minutes by Origin. ATL has the lowest frequency of taxi delays and ORD has the highest. 

### Slide 6

**Managing taxi delays is crucial because these events impact early flights the most, with the highest frequency of taxi delays occurring at 9 and 10 am.**

### Slide 7

**Similarly, the number of busy flights also peaks between 9-10 am.**

### Slide 8

**Addressing factors of early delays is important because they have a trickle-down effect on the rest of the day.**

**On average, planes flying through one of our top 10 airports have 4.3 flights per day.**

### Slide 9

**This is illustrated visually by the increasing frequency of delays over the course of the day.**

### Slide 10

**From our analysis, we recommend looking into Atlanta's traffic management systems for application to other airports.**

**We also suggest focusing on busy periods early in the day to minimize the snowball effect on future delays.**

Now, Annika will talk about the impacts of weather delays.
