## Script
Hello, my name is Charlie Jubera and the item I brought in today is a Hurricanes hockey puck signed by Jaccob Slavin. This hockey puck is significant to me because it represents the connections made through my love of hockey. 

The way my family got the puck is as a gift from a patient that she bonded over hockey with after they were finished with treatment. 

I have made a lot of friends through a shared interest in hockey. In fact, hockey is the reason I am here at the IAA. I learned about the program through someone that I met through hockey.

I would love to talk hockey with anyone that is interested and maybe go to a game.

## Key Points
### BLUF
- First advice is usually 3rd shot drop
- Data says that a player that can use a 3rd shot drop will win 4% more of their serving rallies
- Data is from 39 pro games totaling in more than 1600 rallies
### 3rd Shot
- 3rd shot is the first big choice of the serving side, it dictates a lot about the rally
- Two options: Drive: Hard/Deep, Drop: Soft/Shallow
- Third type of shot called a lob that is not shown because it is rare
### Drive
- Success is defined by a rally that ends with a point for the server
- The average success rate across serving rallies is 39%, shown by the dotted line
- 4% increase in success rate when 3rd shot drive instead of drop
### Why not Drive
- Consistency, you are less likely to have really bad performances over a game when dropping 
- This can be due the fact that when you reduce power you gain control
- 
### Takeaways
- Players should spend more time drilling and using their 3rd shot drive
