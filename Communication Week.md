## Script
Hello, my name is Charlie Jubera and the item I brought in today is a Hurricanes hockey puck signed by Jaccob Slavin. This hockey puck is significant to me because it represents the connections made through my love of hockey. 

The way my family got the puck is as a gift from a patient that she bonded over hockey with after they were finished with treatment. 

I have made a lot of friends through a shared interest in hockey. In fact, hockey is the reason I am here at the IAA. I learned about the program through someone that I met through hockey.

I would love to talk hockey with anyone that is interested and maybe go to a game.
