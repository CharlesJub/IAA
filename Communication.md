# Clifton Strengths 
Each test gives you a different view, but none of the assessments give you a 100% accurate evaluation of who you are.

Negativity Bias: The idea that things that are negative have more impact than neutral or positive things, even if equal in weight

#34 isn't necessarily a weakness, but something that is not as natural for you to implement 

Executing: Getting work done

Influencing: Conveying information

Relationship Building: Keeping a team together

Strategic Thinking: Thinking through a problem


Pitfalls:
- Overuse:
	- Blind spots
	- Wrong place / Wrong time
- Underrate
	- "It's not that special"
	- "Everyone can do it"


The results could be impacted by the time we took the test. In the first weeks of class people might be thinking about building relationships more.
