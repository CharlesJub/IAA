# Graphs 

Line Graph: Track change over time

Side-by-Side Bar Chart: Show parts of a whole, category comparison 

Histogram: Show distribution of a variable 
	Equal width
	Equal frequency

Scatterplot: Compare two numeric variables 

Venn diagram: uniqueness and overlap

*Don't use variables names in a graph*

## Multivariate Glyphs
Visualize high dimensional data

Many ways to show variables, can combine to show many different variables at once. *I think this only works for comparisons between maps, and even then I think it is hard to use well*

Used if there is some relationship between the variables. If no relationship, just use individual maps


# Maps 

- Types
	- Value by region: choropleth
	- Equal-value contour lines: isarithmic or contour map
	- point location and value: proportional symbol
	- feature presence or absence: dot

*Always population correct maps using population*

# Non-traditional Visuals
Pro: Can customize based on needs
Con: Need to explain before highlighting value for audience to understand. Bad for reports because requires extra reading

- Arc diagrams: show frequency of repetition 
- Phrase nets: text analytics tool, show links between words in text using. Links show by prepositions "X and Y" or "X at Y"

# Pre-attentive Features
Basic visual features that are detected rapidly: presences or absence, possible amount

Unique features can capture our focus of attention

Goal is to direct focus of attention of viewer

Draw attention with pop out:
- Change target hue
- Change target shape, works just as well as hue

If you combine both shape and hue, looking for combination as the target doesn't work

Features:

![[Visualization - Graphs and Maps - Preattentive Features 2.png]]

If you give the viewer something to look for they can find a combo of features more effectively 



# Perceptual Guidelines
Color: hue, saturation, luminance, chromaticity (hue + saturation)
Texture: size, orientation, density, regularity of placement
Motion: flicker, phase, direction, velocity

Feature Hierarchy: 
- Luminance dominates hue, Color dominates texture, regularity perceptually weak
- Most important data assigned to luminance
- The hue or chroma
- Then texture, then regularity

# Post-attentive Amnesia
Intuition suggests they will

Experiments show that it doesn't work this way

**Change Blindness**: 
- **Overwriting**: current image overwritten by new one
- First impression: initial view abstracted
- **Noting is stored**
- Feature combination
- **Everything is stored, nothing is compared**

If you prompt someone to look at something they can miss the other aspects of the visualization
