### Notes
A lot more things are feedback than we realize.

Feedback is important, but constantly considered a painful experience. On both sides.

Receiving feedback well does not mean always taking the feedback. It is more about improving how you understand the feedback

Onus on the feedback taker to improve the feedback process.

> We like the word "pull" because it highlights a truth often ignored: that the key variable in your growth is not your teacher or your supervisor. It's you.

Feedback is difficult because we know it is important but it we also want to be accepted. And some feedback can put that into question.

Three types of  Triggers:
 - Truth Trigger: You don't believe the feedback is true
 - Relationship Trigger: You don't think the feedback can come from this person
 - Identity Trigger: You

Three types of Feedback:
- Appreciation: Feedback that shows approval and give motivation
	- Purpose: To se, acknowledge, connect, motivate, thank
- Coaching: Feedback that aims to help you improve 
	- Purpose: 
		- To help receiver expand knowledge, sharpen skill, improve capability
		- to address the giver's feeling or an imbalance in the relationship
- Evaluation: Feedback that aims to align expectations, clarify consequences, and inform decision making
	- To rate or rank against a set of standard, to align expectations, to inform decision making

When you don't include evaluation, the receiver wont know where they stand and will try to fill in the blanks with things said for Coaching and Evaluation 

Appreciation might seem skippable because you feel the feedback receiver is already getting appreciation through other avenues, but it is important to explicitly state appreciation. Good appreciation is specific, tailored to the receiver, and authentic.

Be thoughtful about what type of feedback you need and what type of feedback you're being offered, and get aligned 

Wrong-spotting is looking for what is wrong with the feedback instead of understanding the feedback 

Before we can determine if the feedback is right or wrong we need to fully understand the feedback in depth. We do this by thinking about where it is coming from and where it is going to. 

To avoid wrong-spotting, ask what is different about the perspective of the person giving the feedback. Try to think about what is right about the feedback even if you think it is completely wrong.

Blind spots: Things about ourselves that we can't see, because:
- We can't see our body language
- We can't hear our own voice in full
- We are unaware of patterns of our behavior

Blind spots are amplified by:
- Emotional Math: We don't think about the impact of our outward facing emotions, while other people care a lot about them
- Attribution: We attribute failure to the situation, while other attribute it to our character
- Impact-Intent Gap: We judge ourselves by our intentions, while other judge us by our impact on them
