# Notes
## Chapter 1 - Data Analysis as Art
Data analysis is hard to explain. You can get an abstract framework, but each problem faced is unique and impossible to fully encapsulate in teaching.

## Chapter 2 - Epicycles of Analysis
Data analysis is highly iterative cyclical process
![[EpicyclesOfAnalysis.png]]

A *study* is about developing a plan for collecting data, and *data analysis* presumes the data has been collected

Data analysis can be a part of a study, but not limited to only studies

**Five core activities of data analysis:**
1. Stating and refining the question
2. Exploring the data
3. Building formal statistical models
4. Interpreting the results
5. Communicating the results

**Each step, you should engage in these steps:**
1. Setting Expectations,
2. Collecting information (data), comparing the data to your expectations, and if the expectations don't match,
3. Revising your expectations or fixing the data so your data and your expectations match.

### Setting Expectations
Thinking about what you expect before you do anything

*What to do if you don't have a baseline of knowledge to set expectations? *
	You can use external resources, outside of the dataset, to establish information about your data

### Collecting Information
Collect information about your data **and your question**

For question, search literature or ask experts to ensure your question is a good one

For data, preforming the operation to check your assumptions

### Comparing Expectation to Data
If you expectations were wrong:
- Your expectations were wrong and need to be revised
- Your information was wrong

> One key indicator of how well your data analysis is going is how easy or difficult it is to match the data you collected to your original expectations.

The goal is to have expectations and data that can be easily matched 

*Sharp Hypothesis*: Something that is very specific, that can be verified with the data

### Applying the Epicycle of Analysis Process
It is okay to start at "Your expectations are that the answer to this question is unknown and that the question is answerable", but you still need to research if the question is possible to answer 

> In reality, interpreting results happens along with model building as well as after you’ve finished building your model, but conceptually they are distinct activities.

> Although it may be disappointing that your report does not fully meet your boss’s needs, getting [[Feedback|feedback]] is a critical part of doing a data analysis, and in fact, we would argue that a good data analysis requires communication, feedback, and then actions in response to the feedback.

## Chapter 3 - Stating and Refining the Question
**Six Basic Types of Questions:**
1. Descriptive
	Seeks to summarize a characteristic of a set of data
2. Exploratory
	Analyze data to see if there are patterns, trends, or relationships between variables 
	Looking for patterns that would support proposing a hypothesis 
3. Inferential
	A question that aims to be able to infer what is true, on average, for a population based on a sample 
4. Predictive
	A question that asks what is the expected outcome based on a set of variables.
5. Causal
	A causal question asks about whether changing one factor will change another factor, on average, in a population
6. Mechanistic
	A question that asks *how* the data impacts an outcome
