# Notes
## Chapter 1 - Data Analysis as Art
Data analysis is hard to explain. You can get an abstract framework, but each problem faced is unique and impossible to fully encapsulate in teaching.

## Chapter 2 - Epicycles of Analysis
Data analysis is highly iterative cyclical process

A *study* is about developing a plan for collecting data, and *data analysis* presumes the data has been collected

Data analysis can be a part of a study, but not limited to only studies

**Five core activities of data analysis:**
1. Stating and refining the question
2. Exploring the data
3. Building formal statistical models
4. Interpreting the results
5. Communicating the results

**Each step, you should engage in these steps:**
1. Setting Expectations,
2. Collecting information (data), comparing the data to your expectations, and if the expectations don't match,
3. Revising your expectations or fixing the data so your data and your expectations match.

### Setting Expectations
Thinking about what you expect before you do anything

*What to do if you don't have a baseline of knowledge to set expectations? *
	You can use external resources, outside of the dataset, to establish information about your data

### Collecting Information
Collect information about your data **and your question**

For question, search literature or ask experts to ensure your question is a good one

For data, preforming the operation to check your assumptions

### Comparing Expectation to Data
