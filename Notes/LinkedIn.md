# Hockey Focus
As an aspiring data scientist whose journey began with a hockey analytics passion project. *Using Python, I scraped data from the NHL API, built a logistic regression model, and created a  website to visualize insights, sparking my fascination with data's power to uncover hidden patterns.*

This experience led me to pursue a Masters in Analytics at NC State, where I'm expanding my skills in machine learning, advanced statistical techniques, and communicating results. I'm constantly seeking to broaden my expertise in programming and analytical tools.

Now, I'm eager to apply my unique blend of sports analytics experience and technical skills to solve complex problems across various industries. Seeking opportunities to contribute innovative data-driven solutions and continue growing in this dynamic field.
